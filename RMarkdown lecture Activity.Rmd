### Introduction  

My name is **Nneoma Ugwu** and I am a *Civil Engineering MS/PhD* student. I come from Nigeria and My favorite hobby is ~~dancing~~ gardening. My best equation is the area of a triangle $A = 0.5bh^{2}$    

This new paragraph lists my courses this semester. 

* ENCE688-J 
* ENCE688-I 

### Using the code chunk
Your goal should be to make your codes not only work but be reproducable and easy to follow. You will learn these in later sections. For now we would create a variable, leave comments and do a simple analysis.

```{r}
# Assign variables for fruits and compare 
a <- "apples"
b <- "bananas"
a==b
```

```{r}
# Assign random numbers and compare 
a <- 2
b <- 4/2
a<=b
```

### Conclusion
Congrats! You can use RMarkdown and write codes.
